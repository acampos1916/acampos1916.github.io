[Henrik Kniberg](https://www.crisp.se/konsulter/henrik-kniberg){:target="_blank"} and [Anders Ivarsson](https://aivarsson.wordpress.com/){:target="_blank"}, as agile coaches working with Spotify, published a rather well-known whitepaper outlining an evident problem of big product organizations that keep on growing.

Back in 2012 the "Spotify Model" was a solution to organize tens of diverse teams in Squads, Tribes, Chapters and Guilds.

The full whitepaper can be downloaded from Henrik's blog [here](https://blog.crisp.se/2012/11/14/henrikkniberg/scaling-agile-at-spotify){:target="_blank"}.

Some highlights:

* Squads were small startup-like multidisciplinary teams, multiple Squads formed Tribes that worked in collaborative areas.
* Squads were encouraged to use [Lean Startup principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup#Principles){:target="_blank"} like MVP and validated learnings. “Think it, build it, ship it, tweak it”.
* Quarterly surveys helped assess the kind of organizational support Squads needed and which areas in a Tribe required systematic attention.
* Tribes were smaller than 100 people, following the [Dunbar's number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar's_number){:target="_blank"}.
* Squad dependencies were surveyed to try to unblock priority work and rearrange Tribes when it made sense.
* Chapters were collections of Squad members with a common skill within the same Tribe (e.g. web developers). Guilds were collections of Squad members with a common area of interest across Tribes (e.g. web technologies).
* Chapter Leads and Squad Product Owners had a "healthy" tension where one wanted to slow things down and reach for technical excellence while the other wanted to speed up and deliver fast.
* System Owners and Chief Architects orchestrated all of the above!

The last lines of the whitepaper have a bit of foreshadowing: "However, as with any growing organization, today’s solutions give birth to tomorrow’s problems".
